# Business Problem
Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. We have been providing high-quality air transportation services to our clients for several years, and our primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our passengers. However, we are currently facing challenges due to several factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs. As a result, the company's profitability is under pressure, and they are seeking ways to address this issue. To tackle this challenge, they are looking to conduct an analysis of their database to find ways to increase their occupancy rate, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.
# Conclusion
In summary, analyzing revenue data such as total revenue per year, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft is crucial for airlines aiming to maximize profitability. By assessing these indicators, airlines can identify areas for improvement and adapt their pricing and route plans accordingly. A higher occupancy rate stands as a crucial factor in enhancing profitability since it enables airlines to optimize revenue while minimizing costs related to empty seats. Additionally, airlines should consider revising the pricing strategy for each aircraft. The disparity between lower and higher prices may deter people from purchasing tickets for those specific aircraft. Establishing a reasonable price aligned with the aircraft's condition and facilities is essential, avoiding extremes of overly cheap or expensive prices.

Moreover, increasing occupancy rates should not compromise consumer satisfaction or safety standards. Airlines must strike a balance between the imperative for profit and the importance of delivering high-quality service while upholding stringent safety regulations. By adopting a data-driven approach to revenue analysis and optimization, airlines can potentially achieve long-term success in a highly competitive industry.
